# JavaScript API

You can use `pree` programmatically in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or some compatible runtime. Locally install the package to get started:

```bash
npm i pree
```

<br>

There are three main functions exposed by `pree` that you can use:

</m-d>

<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🫕</span>
  <m-d>
    [**`serve()`**](api#serve) serves local files,
    [handles layout](usage/meta-layout),
    provides [build-env APIs](components/build-env).
  </m-d>
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🏗️</span>
  <m-d>
    [**`build()`**](api#build) calls `serve()`, then pre-renders HTML files and removes [build-only scripts](usage/build-only-scripts),
  </m-d>
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">👀</span>
  <m-d>
    [**`view()`**](api#view) calls `serve()` with live-reloading.
  </m-d>
</emo-li>

### `serve()`

The core of `pree` is the `serve()` function. It will serve local files, handle [meta data and layout](usage/meta-layout) and provide [build-env APIs](components/build-env). It also provides a nice interface for navigating directories.

```js
  import { serve } from 'pree'

  const { port, server } = await serve({ root: 'docs' })
```

<br>

Type signature & options:

```ts
function serve(options?: ServeOptions): Promise&lt;RunningServer&gt;
```
```ts
  interface ServeOptions {
    // 📁 were should we look for files to serve. defaults to cwd.
    root?: string

    // 📍 base URL for your site.
    base?: string

    // 🔌 port to serve on. defaults to 3000.
    port?: number

    // 📦 loaders to use to load various files (see below).
    loaders?: Loader[]

    // 🚀 whether to serve in production mode (no env APIs). defaults to false.
    prod?: boolean

    // ✅ which files to inject build-env info into.
    include?: string[]

    // ❌ which files to exclude from build-env injection.
    exclude?: string[]

    // 🔗 base URL for build-env APIs. defaults to `@env`
    buildEnvPrefix?: string

    // 📣 log level:
    // 0: no logs (silent)
    // 1: errors only
    // 2: errors and warnings
    // 3: errors, warnings and info
    // 4: errors, warnings, info and debug
    logLevel?: number
  }
```
```ts
  type RunningServer = {
    port: number
    server: http.Server
    close: () => Promise<void>
  }
```

<br>

#### Custom Loaders

Use custom loaders to change how specific file types are loaded. For example, you can use a markdown loader to convert `.md` files to HTML. This means your markdown files will be served as HTML, and they will be built into HTML files during build.

```js
  import { serve } from 'pree'
  import { marked } from 'marked'

  await serve({
    root: 'docs',
    loaders: [async (ctx, next) => {
      if (ctx.path.endsWith('.md')) {
        const raw = await readFile(ctx.path, 'utf8')

        return {
          content: marked(raw),
          type: 'text/html'
        }
      } else {
        return await next()
      }
    }]
  })
```

---

### `build()`

Calls [`serve()`](api#serve), then fetches all given HTML files with a headless browser and prebuilds them to given directory. Also removes all [build-only scripts](usage/build-only-scripts) from the prebuilt files.
```js
  import { build } from 'pree'

  await build({
    root: 'docs',
    dir: 'docs',
    target: 'site'
  })
``` 

<br>

Type signature & options:

```ts
function build(options?: BuildOptions): Promise<void>
```
```ts
  interface BuildOptions extends ServeOptions {
    // 📜 which file to build. either one of `file` or `dir` should be given.
    file?: string

    // 📁 which directory to build. either one of `file` or `dir` should be given.
    dir?: string

    // 🚚 where to put the built files. defaults to `dist`.
    target?: string

    // ✅ which files to build.
    include?: string[]

    // ❌ which files to exclude building.
    exclude?: string[]

    // 🔀 how many pages to build concurrently. defaults to 16.
    concurrency?: number
  }
```

---

### `view()`

Calls [`serve()`](api#serve), but also watches given files and automatically reloads the browser whenever there is a change.
Takes the same options as `serve()`.

```js
  import { view } from 'pree'

  await view({ root: 'docs' })
```

<br>

Type signature & options:

```ts
function view(options?: ViewOptions): Promise&lt;RunningViewer&gt;
```
```ts
type ViewOptions = ServeOptions
```
```ts
  type RunningViewer = RunningServer & {
    watcher: chokidar.FSWatcher
    ws: WebSocketServer
  }
```

### Proper Use Cases

Using the JavaScript API you can build various applications on top of `pree`. That said, `pree` is still built and optimized for a prebuilding a static collection of HTML files. It is NOT optimised for other use cases such as server-side rendering of dynamic content.

Specifically: `pree` prebuilds HTML files and speeds up loading by moving the wait time of the initial page load from client side to the build time. Based on the page, this can be pretty time consuming. In case of a fixed set of HTML files this overhead is resolved by prebuilding multiple pages concurrently. However that optimisation might not work in other contexts and use cases, so take that into consideration when you are using `pree`'s APIs.
