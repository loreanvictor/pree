## Publishing Components

You can easily share your components by publishing them through [NPM](https://npmjs.com), where they can get used via CDNs such as [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) or [esm.sh](https://esm.sh). In this page we discuss a few good practices for publishing web components that integrate with `pree`. Checkout [this checklist](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki) and [these guides](https://open-wc.org/guides/publishing/) some recommendations for publishing web components in general.

### SSR Support

ðŸ‘‰ If your component is interactive, make sure it supports [SSR](components/ssr). This will make your website interactive faster on the client, as the pre-rendered DOM won't be recreated and is just hydrated. Use libraries such as [minicomp](https://github.com/loreanvictor/minicomp) and [rehtm](https://github.com/loreanvictor/rehtm) to make your components easily SSR-friendly.

```js
  import { define } from 'https://esm.sh/minicomp'
  import { ref, template } from 'https://esm.sh/rehtm'

  define('a-button', () => {
    const span = ref()
    let count = 0
    
    return template`
      &lt;button onclick=${() =&gt; span.current.textContent = ++count}&gt;
        Clicked &lt;span ref=${span} role="status"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; times
      &lt;/button&gt;
    `
  })
```

### Using Build Environment

ðŸ‘‰ If your component accesses [build environment](components/build-env), check for availability and version of the APIs
so that your component doesn't cause errors if used in other environments:

```js
  if (window.BUILD_ENV_API) {
    // use the APIs
  }
```

<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Base URL for the APIs might change in some environments. Use `BUILD_ENV_API.baseURL` instead of `/@env/`:
```js
const res = await fetch(`${BUILD_ENV_API.baseURL}git/remote/info`)
```


<br>

It is recommended to also check the version of `pree` to ensure the APIs you need are provided. Use `BUILD_ENV_API.provider` to check that information:

```js
  window.BUILD_ENV_API.provider
  // pree@0.1.13
```

```js
  import { satisfies } from 'https://esm.sh/semver'

  const buildEnvAccess = supportedVersions => {
    if (!window.BUILD_ENV_API) return false

    const [host, version] = window.BUILD_ENV_API.provider.split('@')
    if (host === 'pree' &amp;&amp; satisfies(version, supportedVersions)) {
      return true
    } else {
      return false
    }
  }

  if (buildEnvAccess('^0.1.10')) {
    // use the APIs
  }
```

<br>

> It is highly recommended to ensure that your components can function properly
> even if access to build environment is not available. If not, users might get confused about when and where
> they can use your components.
