## Usage

👉 Prebuild a single HTML file:

```bash
pree build docs/my-page.html site/my-page.html
```

This prebuilds `docs/my-page.html` into `site/my-page.html`:

</m-d>

<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🧬</span><m-d>Pre-renders web components, using [declarative shadow DOM](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/declarative-shadow-dom).</m-d>
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🏗️</span> Resolves <a href="usage/meta-layout">metadata and layouts</a>,
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">👻</span>Removes <a href="usage/build-only-scripts">build-only scripts and components</a>.
</emo-li>

<br>

<m-d>

👉 Prebuild an entire directory:

```bash
pree build docs site
```
Copies over the contents of `docs` into `site`, then prebuilds all HTML files, except the ones excluded by [CLI options or configuration](usage/config.html). Files beginning with an underline (e.g. `_layout.html`) are excluded by default.

<br>

👉 Preview your website:

```bash
pree view docs
```
</m-d>

<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">👀</span>Loads your website without prebuilding it,
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🏗️</span>Still resolves <a href="usage/meta-layout">metadata and layouts</a>,
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🔃</span>Live reloads on change,
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">📁</span>Also lists directory content for easy navigation.
</emo-li>

<m-d>

> Performance of your pages in preview mode is much slower than in production mode, since
> the content is not prebuilt. To double check the performance of your prebuilt website, first build it:
> ```bash
> pree build docs site
> ``` 
> Then check the prebuilt website:
> ```bash
> pree check site
> ```

### Asset Management

`pree` is NOT an asset manager. It copies the contents of the directory it should build, so assets located in that directory can safely be referenced in your HTML files:

```text
  docs/
   ├─ assets/
   │   ├─ styles.css
   │   └─ logo.png
   └─ my-page.html
```
```html
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles.css"&gt;
&lt;img src="assets/logo.png"&gt;
```

<br>

Sometimes the base URL for your website is not the root of your domain. For example, in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), without a custom domain, your website will be hosted at `https://username.github.io/repo/`. In this case, you can set the base URL in the `head` of your HTML files:

```html
&lt;base href="/repo/"&gt;
```

And specify a _base_ option to `pree`:

```bash
pree build docs site -b repo
```

<blockquote>

  💡 **IMPORTANT**

`&lt;base&gt;` tag doesn't play nice with relative paths in subdirectories. For example, for a project like this:

```text
 blog
  └─ post-1/
      ├─ index.html
      └─ figure.png
```

If you set the base URL to `/blog/`, the following won't work:

```html
<!-- blog/post-1/index.html -->

&lt;base href="/blog/"&gt;

...

&lt;img src="./figure.png"&gt;

<!-- ❌ Here, ./figure.png is not resolved relative to index.html.
      It is resolved relative to /blog/, which is the base URL.
      i.e., it becomes /blog/figure.png, which is WRONG. -->
```

If you want to use relative paths like this, DO NOT use the `&lt;base&gt;` tag. You can still provide the _base_ option to `pree` so that it emulates your hosting environment.

### Config File

👉 Create a config file so you don't have to specify `pree`'s options everytime:

```yaml
# .pree.yml
base: repo
src: docs
dest: site
```

`pree` will look for `.pree.yml` in the current working directory, and use it as the default configuration:

```bash
pree view          # 👈 this is equal to `pree view docs`
```
```bash
pree build         # 👈 this is equal to `pree view build`
```
```bash
pree check         # 👈 this is equal to `pree check site`
```
