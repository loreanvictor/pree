# Usage

ðŸ‘‰ Preview your website:

```bash
pree view
```
```bash
pree view <dir>
```

- `<dir>` is optional. If not provided, the current directory will be used.

`pree view` starts a local server for viewing various files, also resolves layouting and metadata of HTML files. It also provides a nice file navigator to browse your content.

<br>

ðŸ‘‰  Prebuild your website:

```bash
pree build <src> <dest>
```

- `<src>` can be an HTML file or a directory. If it's a directory, all HTML files in it will be processed recursively.
- `<dest>` can be a file or a directory. If `<src>` is a directory, then `<dest>` must be a directory as well.

`pre build` builds one or more HTML files, pre-rendering their web components. It launches a local server and uses an emulated browser to pre-render the files, mimicking actual browser behavior.

<br>

Example:

```bash
pree build docs/index.html dist/index.html
```
```bash
pree build docs/ dist/
```

> âš¡ **IMPORTANT**
>
> `pree` uses [declarative shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM#declaratively_with_html) for prerendering web components. Declarative shadow DOM is a relatively new feature not supported by [older browsers](https://caniuse.com/declarative-shadow-dom). Browsers that don't support it won't get the benefits of pre-rendering
> web components. This also means that [build time components](#build-time-scripts) won't work in these browsers.
