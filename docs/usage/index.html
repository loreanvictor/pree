## Usage

👉 Prebuild a single HTML file:

```bash
pree build docs/my-page.html site/my-page.html
```

This prebuilds `docs/my-page.html` into `site/my-page.html`:

</m-d>

<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🧬</span> pre-renders web components,
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🏗️</span> resolves <a href="usage/meta-layout">metadata and layouts</a>,
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">👻</span>removes <a href="usage/build-only-scripts">build-only scripts and components</a>.
</emo-li>

<br>

<m-d>

👉 Prebuild an entire directory:

```bash
pree build docs site
```
This will copy over all the content of `docs` into `site` and prebuild all HTML files, except the ones excluded by CLI options or configuration. You can also specify include options (in config or CLI options), and then only the specified files will be prebuilt.

<br>

👉 Preview your website:

```bash
pree view docs
```
</m-d>

<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">👀</span> it loads your website without prebuilding it,
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🏗️</span> it still resolves <a href="usage/meta-layout">metadata and layouts</a>,
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">🔃</span> it live reloads on change,
</emo-li>
<emo-li>
  <span slot="emo">📁</span> it also lists directory content for easy navigation.
</emo-li>

<m-d>

> Performance of your pages in preview mode is much slower than in production mode, since
> the content is not prebuilt. To double check the performance of your prebuilt website, first build it:
> ```bash
> pree build docs site
> ``` 
> Then check the prebuilt website in production mode:
> ```bash
> pree check site
> ```

### Asset Management

`pree` is NOT an asset manager. It will copy the content of the directory it builds, so you can conveniently include your assets using relative paths:

```
/docs/
  /assets/
    /styles.css
    /logo.png
  /my-page.html
```
```html
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles.css"&gt;
&lt;img src="assets/logo.png"&gt;
```

In some cases the base URL for your website is not the root of your domain. For example, in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), without a custom domain, your website will be hosted at `https://username.github.io/repo/`. In this case, you can set the base URL in the `head` of your HTML files:

```html
&lt;base href="/repo/"&gt;
```

And specify a _base_ option to `pree`:

```bash
pree build docs site -b repo
```

---

### Config File

For more convenient usage of `pree`, you can create a config file to specify `pree`'s options:

```yaml
# .pree.yml
base: repo
src: docs
dest: site
```

`pree` will look for `.pree.yml` in the current working directory, and use it as the default configuration:

```bash
pree view          # 👈 this is equal to `pree view docs`
```
```bash
pree build         # 👈 this is equal to `pree view build`
```
```bash
pree check         # 👈 this is equal to `pree check site`
```
