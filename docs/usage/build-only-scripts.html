## Build-Only Scripts

Many components are static: they don't need to be shipped to or executed on the client after they've been pre-rendered.
For example, you might want to write your pages using markdown. You could use components such as [zero-md](https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md/) to do that:

```html
  &lt;script type="module" src="https://esm.sh/zero-md"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  <zero-md>
    &lt;script type="text/markdown"&gt;
      # Hello, World!

      This is some markdown that I've written.
    &lt;/script&gt;
  </zero-md>
```

After `pree` pre-renders this HTML, there is no need to parse the markdown and re-render it on the client. Clients will unnecessarily download a whole markdown parser and parse all of this markdown.

👉 Add `build-only` attribute to scripts that don't need to be loaded by the client:

```html
&lt;script build-only type="module" src="https://esm.sh/zero-md"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

`pree` will remove any such script from the final HTML:

&ensp; 🧬 &ensp; these scripts are also removed from inside web components, \
&ensp; ⚡ &ensp; this will increase performance by reducing executed scripts, \
&ensp; 📦 &ensp; this will reduce asset size that's downloaded.

> #### ⚠️ Compatibility
> 
> All of this relies on [declerative shadow DOM](https://web.dev/declarative-shadow-dom/), which [some browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=declarative%20shadow%20dom) might not support yet. Such browsers can't display the pre-rendered content of such components at all. If you need to support such browsers, ensure to include the code of all components and only use `build-only` on scripts that will modify the actual DOM during pre-rendering.
