`pree` is a minimalistic tool that prebuilds HTML files, and:

üß¨ it pre-renders web components (faster loading, MUCH smoother UX), \
üèóÔ∏è it handles layouting and shared metadata (no copy-pasta, breezy DX), \
üëª it enables build-time only components and scripts (even faster loading), \
‚ú® it provides access to build environment to components and scripts (for some magical web components).

<br>

It is designed to create static sites such as blogs or docs using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript with great UX and DX,
without using any build tools or frameworks.

# Motivation

With modern web features such as [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [import maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap), [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), [nested styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting) and [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), ... we can easily build websites by writing and serving plain HTML, CSS and JS (an approach called [no build](https://world.hey.com/dhh/you-can-t-get-faster-than-no-build-7a44131c)). Unfortunately there are still a few minor drawbacks:

- Web components are rendered on the client (slower / jankier page load)
- Multiple HTML pages share layout and metadata (tons of copy-paste)
- Some components are static and don't need to be shipped to clients (larger bundles)
- Some components need to access build environment (e.g. imagine a list of all available pages)

<br>

`pree` aims to fill in these gaps while being as minimalsitc and standard-compliant as possible.

<br>

# Installation

You need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). Use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) or install globally:

```bash
npx pree view
```
```bash
npm i -g pree
```

To update (or to ensure you are using the latest version), use `@latest` tag:

```bash
npx pree@latest view
```
```bash
npm i -g pree@latest
```

<br>

# Usage

üëâ Preview your website:

```bash
pree view
```
```bash
pree view <dir>
```

- `<dir>` is optional. If not provided, the current directory will be used.

`pree view` starts a local server for viewing various files, also resolves layouting and metadata of HTML files. It also provides a nice file navigator to browse your content.

<br>

üëâ  Prebuild your website:

```bash
pree build <src> <dest>
```

- `<src>` can be an HTML file or a directory. If it's a directory, all HTML files in it will be processed recursively.
- `<dest>` can be a file or a directory. If `<src>` is a directory, then `<dest>` must be a directory as well.

`pre build` builds one or more HTML files, pre-rendering their web components. It launches a local server and uses an emulated browser to pre-render the files, mimicking actual browser behavior.

<br>

Example:

```bash
pree build docs/index.html dist/index.html
```
```bash
pree build docs/ dist/
```

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> `pree` uses [declarative shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM#declaratively_with_html) for prerendering web components. Declarative shadow DOM is a relatively new feature not supported by [older browsers](https://caniuse.com/declarative-shadow-dom). Browsers that don't support it won't get the benefits of pre-rendering
> web components. This also means that [build time components](#build-time-scripts) won't work in these browsers.

<br>

## Metadata

Use [front matter](https://www.scribendi.com/academy/articles/front_matter.en.html#:~:text=Front%20matter%20is%20the%20first,a%20preface%2C%20and%20much%20more.) on top of your HTML files to specify metadata:

```html
---
title: My Page
keywords:
  - Technology
  - Web
  - JavaScript
summary: This is my page
---

<h1>This is my page</h1>
<p>
  And it is about programming web applications in JavaScript or some other topic.
</p>
```

<br>

## Layouting

Specify the layout to be used for a page inside the front matter:

```html
---
title: My Page
layout: ./layouts/_main.html
---

<h1>My Page</h1>
<p>
  This is my page.
</p>
```
```html
<!-- ./layouts/_main.html -->
<aside>Contents of the side menu</aside>
<main>
  <!-- üëá This is where content would go -->
  <slot></slot>
</main>
<footer>Some footer content</footer>
```

<br>

Use named slots to fill in different parts of the parent layout:

```html
---
title: My Page
layout: ./layouts/_main.html
---

<h1>My Page</h1>
<p>
  This is my page.
</p>
<span slot="footer">Some extra footer content</span>
```
```html
<!-- ./layouts/_main.html -->
<aside>Contents of the side menu</aside>
<main>
  <!-- üëá This is where content would go -->
  <slot></slot>
</main>
<footer>
  Some generic footer content |
  <!-- üëá This is where content with slot=footer will go -->
  <slot name="footer"></slot>
</footer>
```

<br>

Elements with named slots should reside on the root of the child document. `pree` will ignore them otherwise
as they might be part of a web component template.
```html
---
layout: ./layouts/_main.html
---
<!-- ‚úÖ This is OK -->
<span slot="footer">Some extra footer content</span>
```
```html
---
layout: ./layouts/_main.html
---
<!-- ‚ùå This is WRONG (man). -->
<div>
  <span slot="footer">Some extra footer content</span>
</div>
```

<br>

## Build Time Scripts

Use `build-only` attribute on scripts to remove them from the built files:

```html
<script build-only>
  console.log('This will only be executed during pree build');
</script>
```
```html
<script build-only src="./components/my-component.js" type="module"></script>
<my-component>Ladida</my-component>

<!-- üñï The component will be loaded and prerendered in build time. It won't be loaded on the client. -->
```

<br>

> [!TIP]
> All build time scripts will be loaded and executed during `pree view` as well.

> [!NOTE]
> [Browsers that don't support declarative shdow DOM](https://caniuse.com/declarative-shadow-dom) won't render
> built-time components properly. If you want to support them, make sure to load all web components on the client
> as well.

<br>

## Build Environment

Access build environment from your scripts and components:

```html
<script build-only>
  // üëá Lets get the name of the author of the project
  //    and add it to the meta tag.
  fetch('/@env/git/commits/first')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(commit => {
      document.querySelector('meta[name="author"]').content = commit.author_name
    })
</script>
```

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should ONLY access build environment in build-time only scripts and components. The APIs
> ARE NOT available on production.

## CLI Options

Here is a comprehensive list of CLI options for `pree`:

| Option              | Description | Example |
| ---                 | ---         | ---     |
| `-p`, `--port`      | Port to use for serving content | `pree view -p 8080` |
| `-P`, `--prod`      | Production mode (no build environment APIs) | `pree view -P` |
| `-r`, `--root`      | Root directory of the content | `pree build docs site -r .` |
| `-N`, `--namespace` | Project namespace<sup>*</sup> | `pree view -N my-project` |
| `-i`, `--include`   | Files to include in the build | `pree build docs site -i "**/*.page.html"` |
| `-e`, `--exclude`   | Files to exclude from the build<sup>**</sup> | `pree build docs site -e "**/*.layout.html"` |
| `-V`, `--verbose`   | Verbose mode | `pree view -V` |
| `-S`, `--silent`    | Silent mode (only warnings and errors) | `pree build index.html dist/index.html -S` |
| `-SS`               | Silent-er mode (only errors) | `pree build docs dist -SS` |
| `-SSS`              | Silent-est mode (no logs)    | `pree view -SSS` |
| `-h`, `--help`      | See a really short help message | `pree -h` |
| `-v`, `--version`   | See the version of `pree` (and if it needs updates) | `pree -v` |

<br>

**<sup>*</sup>** In some hosting environments your project is not at the root of your domain, which affects your
relative URLs. Use this option to have `pree view` emulate that. For example, if your project is hosted at
`https://example.com/my-project/`, then use `pree view -N my-project`.

**<sup>**</sup>** By default, `**/_*` is used as an excluded pattern. When you provide another exclude pattern, this default pattern is no longer used.

Make sure all checks are successful on your PRs. This includes all tests passing, high code coverage, correct typings and abiding all [the linting rules](https://github.com/loreanvictor/pree/blob/main/.eslintrc). The code is typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Jest](https://jestjs.io) is used for testing and coverage reports, [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [TypeScript ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io) are used for linting.

```bash
# run tests
npm test
