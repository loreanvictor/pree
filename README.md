# Contribution

You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to start and [git](https://git-scm.com) to start.

```bash
# clone the code
git clone git@github.com:loreanvictor/pree.git
```
```bash
# install stuff
npm i
```

Make sure all checks are successful on your PRs. This includes all tests passing, high code coverage, correct typings and abiding all [the linting rules](https://github.com/loreanvictor/pree/blob/main/.eslintrc). The code is typed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Jest](https://jestjs.io) is used for testing and coverage reports, [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [TypeScript ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io) are used for linting. Subsequently, IDE integrations for TypeScript and ESLint would make your life much easier (for example, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) supports TypeScript out of the box and has [this nice ESLint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)), but you could also use the following commands:

```bash
# run tests
npm test
```
```bash
# check code coverage
npm run coverage
```
```bash
# run linter
npm run lint
```
```bash
# run type checker
npm run typecheck
```
